# Audio Samples

This directory contains audio files used for testing and demonstration in Lab 3.
Because GitHub repositories should not include large binary files, the actual
audio files are not stored here. Instead, we provide file names and instructions
so you know where to place your own samples.

## Structure

- `clean_speech.mp3` – high quality speech for baseline transcription.
- `noisy_background.mp3` – contains music or noise to test preprocessing.
- `contains_credit_card.mp3` – includes a fake credit card number for PII testing.
- `fast_speech.mp3` – features rapid speech to challenge the recogniser.
- `low_quality_phone.mp3` – simulates a low quality phone call.
-  Personalised audio files for each student see README.md in the Lab 3 folder for full instructions on how to hand in homework
