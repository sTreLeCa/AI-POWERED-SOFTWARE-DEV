# Reflection Template

For your Lab 3 submission, include a 300-word reflection in a file named `reflection.md`.
Use the following questions to structure your reflection. Answer each question with specific
examples and numbers drawn from your own pipeline output.

## Questions

1. **Preprocessing:** How did your preprocessing (normalisation and noise reduction) affect
   the accuracy of your transcription? Provide before/after confidence scores or error rates.

2. **PII Detection:** What challenges did you encounter when detecting and redacting
   personally identifiable information? Were any false positives or false negatives observed?

3. **Confidence Scoring:** Which confidence factor (API score, SNR, or perplexity) proved
   most reliable in your experiments? Explain why, referencing your combined scores.

4. **Production Considerations:** If you were deploying this pipeline in a production
   application, what improvements would you make? Consider scalability, security, and user experience.
