### Data Flow

**Example Flow: User Query → AI Response**

1. User enters query in frontend
2. Frontend validates input and shows loading state
3. Request sent to `/api/query` endpoint
4. Backend:
   - Sanitizes input (check for prompt injection)
   - Generates embedding of query
   - Searches vector DB for relevant context (top 5 results)
   - Constructs prompt with retrieved context
   - Calls OpenAI API with prompt
   - Streams response back to frontend
   - Logs latency, cost, and user feedback
5. Frontend displays response with citations

**Critical Path Latency Budget:**
- Frontend validation: <100ms
- Backend processing: <500ms
- Vector search: <300ms
- LLM generation: <3000ms
- **Total target: <4 seconds**

- Context length: [e.g., Max 4000 tokens]
- Temperature: [e.g., 0.7 for creative, 0 for factual]
